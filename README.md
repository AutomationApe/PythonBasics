# PythonBasics
Documenting the basics of Python as I progress in the language

Python is a high-level interpreted general purpose programming language. 
The highlight for Python is the fact that it promotes increased productivity thanks to its simple syntax.
Python is used in practically all facets of development: from Web Development to Machine Learning.

Python Built-in Data Types:

	Numeric: int, float, complex

	Text: str

	Sequence: list, tuple, range

	Mapping: dict

	Set: set, frozenset

	Boolean: bool

	Binary: bytes, bytearray, memoryview

	None: NoneType

Setting variables of each data type:

	x = "Hello World" (str)

	x = 20    (int)

	x = 20.5  (float)

	x = 1j    (complex)

	x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] (list)

	x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") (tuple)

	x = range(6)  (range)

	x = {"name": "John", "age": 35}   (dict)

	x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} (set)

	x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})  (frozenset)

	x = True  (bool)

	x = b"Hello"  (bytes)

	x = bytearray(5)  (bytearray)

	x = memoryview(bytes(5))  (memoryview)

	x = None  (NoneType)
